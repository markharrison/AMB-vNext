create a zip file for the app code so that it can be deployed to azure in the following manner:

az webapp deploy \
  --resource-group MyRG \
  --name MyWebApp \
  --src-path ./app.zip

Also add the correct terminal command to any deployment scripts you are creating or have created to deploy it.

Make sure app.zip or any .zip files are not excluded by the gitignore file so you can add the app.zip file to the repo for use later in the script

Make sure the app.zip folder unzips to give app folder that has dll file inside it,
do not add another folder level in between like publish folder or other.

to be clear you must avoid this issue: "The issue is that the files are in an app/ subdirectory within the zip file. Azure App Service expects the files to be at the root of the zip."

make it clear to the user somewhere that the URL to view the app is <app url>/Index so they dont just navigate to the root url
