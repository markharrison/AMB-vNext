Create the Bicep code needed to deploy an Azure SQL Database with the following security requirements:

1. **Azure AD-Only Authentication (Required by Policy)**:
   - Set `azureADOnlyAuthentication: true` in the administrators configuration
   - This is a mandatory MCAPS governance policy requirement
   - SQL authentication must be disabled

2. **Entra ID Administrator**:
   - Configure the SQL server with Entra ID (Azure AD) authentication
   - Set the person deploying as the named administrator
   - Include their Object ID and User Principal Name

3. **Managed Identity Access**:
   - Grant the managed identity created earlier access to the server
   - Assign ##MS_DatabaseManager## permissions to the managed identity

4. **Database Configuration**:
   - Create a database named 'Northwind'
   - Use Basic tier for development
   - Enable firewall rule for Azure services

5. **Schema Import Using Azure Native Methods**:
   - Use Azure CLI `az sql db import` command or similar native Azure tooling to import the schema
   - The schema file is located at: `Database-Schema/Northwinds Schema.sql`
   - Do NOT rely on local Python scripts or ODBC drivers for schema import
   - The import should use Azure AD authentication
   - Consider using Azure Deployment Scripts (Microsoft.Resources/deploymentScripts) in Bicep to run the import as part of the infrastructure deployment
   - Alternatively, provide Azure CLI commands that can be run from Azure Cloud Shell or as part of the deployment pipeline

**Schema Import Best Practices**:
- Use `az sql db query` to execute the SQL file directly against the database
- Authenticate using the Azure AD identity of the deployer
- Example command structure:
  ```bash
  az sql db query --server <server-name> --database Northwind --auth-mode ActiveDirectoryIntegrated --file "Database-Schema/Northwinds Schema.sql"
  ```

**Important**: The `azureADOnlyAuthentication` must be set to `true` to comply with the "[SFI-ID4.2.2] SQL DB - Safe Secrets Standard" policy enforced by MCAPS Governance.
