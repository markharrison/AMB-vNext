[NOT USED] add a setting in the deploy.sh file which will be include-chat-ui and it is defaulted to false which means the genAI IaC will NOT be deployed 
even though the chat UI files will remain active but not work.
if this is set to TRUE then the IaC for GenAI will be deployed.
update the docs to make it clear how to deploy with and without the chat ui, but make sure the default instruction is simple.
make sure the setting from the deploy.sh file is used as a variable in the genai bicep file and hence changing it once reflects all places in the bicep files.
to be clear do not use a new variable defining the use of the genai feature in the genai bicep or main bicep files, just pass the setting from the deploy.sh
