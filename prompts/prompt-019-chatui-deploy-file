create deploy-with-chat.sh file that will deploy everything including genai services needed for the chat ui. It should deploy the genai services first and then get the resulting endpoints etc 
for the next steps because it will need to set the app service environment variables for OpenAI and Search:

  OPENAI_ENDPOINT=$(echo $DEPLOYMENT_OUTPUT | jq -r '.openAIEndpoint.value')
  OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=$(echo $DEPLOYMENT_OUTPUT | jq -r '.openAIModelName.value')
  SEARCH_ENDPOINT=$(echo $DEPLOYMENT_OUTPUT | jq -r '.searchEndpoint.value')

To be clear we will have a deploy.sh that deploys any db and app but no genai services and then a deploy-with-chat.sh that
deploys the genai bicep files. With both types of deployment 
there will be a chat user interface reachable but if genai resources 
were not deployed then the chatui will give dummy responses explaining that the GEnAI services were not deployed
and to deploy the deploy-with-chat file to get the extra experience
